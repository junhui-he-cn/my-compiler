# M0.5B `cdbc 0.1` Contract Audit and Evolution Decision

Status: implemented against reference commit `42b9da1`.

## Current contract

The existing line-oriented UTF-8 `.cdbc` artifact is the current versioned
compiler/VM contract:

```text
cdbc 0.1
```

The core envelope is ordered as `constants`, `names`, `main`, and zero or more
`function` sections. `debug_sources` and `debug_locations` are optional
additive sections. The Rust parser is strict about section order, sequential
references, instruction shapes, debug mappings, unknown sections, and trailing
input; its `dump` formatter is the canonical text representation.

The audit covers every `artifact` runner case in the current verification
inventory: 116 case IDs over 58 checked-in `expected.cdbc` fixtures. Every case
records the observed header/version and envelope capabilities in the audit
report. All 58 fixtures contain optional debug sources and locations; 28 contain
functions and 31 contain `native_call` instructions.

## Audit results

The executable audit is `tests/cdbc_contract_audit.py`. It reuses
`tests/bytecode_artifact_tests.py`, dumps every reference artifact through the
Rust VM, and probes invalid family/version headers through `dump` only:

| Check | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| artifact assertions | 116/116 |
| reference Rust dumps | 58/58 byte-for-byte |
| invalid family/version probes | 2/2 rejected |
| VM `run` calls for invalid probes | 0 |

The checked-in machine-readable baseline is
`docs/verification/m05b-baseline.json`; the per-case capability and dynamic
evidence report is `docs/verification/m05b-artifact-audit-report.json`.
Reproduce it in a build directory with:

```sh
python3 tests/cdbc_contract_audit.py \
  ./build/compiler_design vm-rs \
  --report build/m05b-cdbc-audit-report.json
```

The reference corpus digest is
`00aa8ea18d26b303dd76e0542b509b19add9af5ca112668807c8897a8f277c64`, computed
from sorted artifact paths and their complete-text SHA-256 values.

## Evolution classification

| Candidate | Classification | Current decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| artifact kind | already present | `cdbc` header, extension, and CLI identify the current kind |
| debug sources/locations | already present | optional source-mapped runtime metadata is consumed by the Rust VM |
| unknown-section policy | already present | strict rejection protects older readers |
| runtime/target identity | deferred | wait for a second runtime, target, or transport consumer |
| capability flags | deferred | wait for a named negotiation requirement |
| module identity | deferred | depends on M3 separate-compilation ownership |
| explicit framing | not currently required | no streaming, binary, or embedded transport exists |
| integrity metadata | deferred | requires a trust boundary or shared artifact cache |
| successor version/negotiation | successor-version candidate | conditional M4A path only if a breaking change is selected |

Every deferred, not-currently-required, or successor candidate has a named
revisit milestone and condition in
`docs/decisions/m05b-cdbc-contract.json`. The successor candidate has a named
M4A consumer and planned compatibility fixtures, but it is not selected now.

## Successor decision

M0.5B selects no successor version. The current 0.1 envelope already covers
the present C++ compiler/Rust VM pair, including core instructions, native calls,
optional debug metadata, strict parse/dump, and runtime diagnostics. Adding
fields without a concrete consumer or transport would create speculative ABI
surface.

M4A owns any later choice of supported version ranges, negotiation, migration,
rejection behavior, deprecation period, and older-version lifecycle. A
successor becomes justified only when a breaking opcode/value-layout change,
second runtime/target, separate artifact product, or named transport/security
requirement cannot be expressed as a compatible 0.1 extension.

## Migration and deletion rules

M0.5B changes no artifact reader, writer, default emission, or VM behavior. The
current 0.1 reader/writer, canonical dumps, diagnostics, and execution results
remain the M4A reference corpus. Invalid family/version input must continue to
fail in Rust parsing before VM execution.

No old artifact path is deleted in this slice. M4A may change or remove 0.1
support only after its compatibility matrix, migration/rejection policy, and
support lifecycle are checked in and verified.
